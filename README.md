## Introduction
Dengue is a viral disease that is transmitted by mosquitoes in tropical areas that affects millions of people each year of all nationalities. It is estimated that there are close to 390 million infections of the disease each year â€“ including about 500,000 severe cases that mostly affect children. It is said that severe cases can cause extreme bleeding, low blood pressure, and eventually lead to death. Dengue is now considered endemic in over 100 countries and several US territories. The disease was once only located in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. It is now spreading to parts of Latin America. More troubling for the US, in recent years, dengue outbreaks have hit several states where the Aedes vector mosquitoes are endemic.

The hope of this study aims to see if the spread of the disease is related to climate variables such as temperature, precipitation and humidity, and to see if steps can be taken to reduce the impact of Dengue and reduce future epidemics. Data has been collected from multiple sources to perform this study such as: US Federal Government agencies (like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration), US Department of Commerce, and US universities.


## Research Question
The goal of this project is to predict the total cases for each (city, year, and weekofyear) in the test set, and the project will be evaluated using the mean absolute error. There will be predictions for both the city of San Juan and Iquitos. Our group plans to use several types of analyses to help predict the total cases such as linear regression, random forests, and potentially neural networks. The linear regression will give us a baseline to estimate on using the more advanced models like random forest.
